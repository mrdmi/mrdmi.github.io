    <h1>The Earth</h1>
    <img src="images/earth.png" alt="Cartoon Earth image">
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">Sun</a> and the only astronomical 
      object known to harbor and support life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. 
      The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies,
      but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere. 
      Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. </p>
      
    <p>Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, 
      while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field">Earth's magnetic field</a>, 
      and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.</p>
